In this notebook, we look at the basics of gate-model quantum computing, which is sometimes also referred to as universal quantum computing. Most academic and commercial efforts to build a quantum computer focus on this model: Alibaba, Baidu, Google, HP, IBM Q, Intel, IonQ, Microsoft, Rigetti Computing, and Tencent all aim at this, and the list keeps expanding. It remains unclear which implementation will prove scalable: superconducting chips, photonic systems, and ion traps are the most common types, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. We abstract away, we focus on the quantum algorithms irrespective of the physical implementation.\n",
