Since the probability amplitudes are complex and there are two of them for a single qubit, this would require a four-dimensional space. Now since the vectors are normalized, this removes a degree of freedom, allowing a three-dimensional representation with an appropriate embedding. This embedding is the Bloch sphere. It is slightly different than an ordinary sphere in three dimensions: we identify the north pole with the state $|0\\rangle$, and the south pole with $|1\\rangle$. In other words, two orthogonal vectors appear as if they were on the same axis -- the axis Z. The computational basis is just one basis: the axes X and Y represent two other bases. Any point on the surface of this sphere is a valid quantum state. This is also true the other way around: every pure quantum state is a point on the Bloch sphere. Here it 'pure' is an important technical term and it essentially means that the state is described by a ket (column vector). Later in the course we will see other states called mix states that are not described by a ket (you will see later that these are inside the Bloch sphere).\n",
