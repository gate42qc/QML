                "Kernel methods are widespread in machine learning and they were particularly common before deep learning became a dominant paradigm. The core idea is to introduce a new notion of distance between high-dimensional data points by replacing the inner product $(x_i, x_j)$ by a function that retains many properties of the inner product, yet which is nonlinear. This function $k(.,.)$ is called a kernel. Then, in many cases, wherever a learning algorithm would use an inner product, the kernel function is used instead.\n",

                "The intuition is that the kernel function acts as an inner product on a higher dimensional space and encompasses some $\\phi(.)$ mapping from the original space of the data points to this space. So intuitively, the kernel function is $k(x_i, x_j)=(\\phi(x_i), \\phi(x_j))$. The hope is that points that were not linearly separable in the original space become linearly separable in the higher dimensional space. The $\\phi(.)$ function may map to an infinite dimensional space and it does not actually have to be specified. As long as the kernel function is positive semidefinite, the idea works.\n",

Some important kernels are listed below.\n",

For instance, interference is a very natural thing to do: we showed an option in the first notebook on quantum states, and it can also be done with a Hadamard gate. For instance, imagine that you have training vectors encoded in some register, and this register is entangled with the $|0\\rangle$ in the superposition of an ancilla. The ancilla's $|1\\rangle$ of the superposition is entangled with another register that contains the test vector. Applying the Hadamard on the ancilla interferes the test and training instances.
